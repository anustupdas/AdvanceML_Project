Preprocessing data (see http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html):
 - do we need standardization, mean removal, variance scaling for our algorithm
 - replace NAN with mean of column? ->(http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.Imputer.html)
	-> Maybe taking mean evrywhere is not the best option?
 - outlier detection?


Choose important Features(http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/unsupervised_reduction.html):
- which method can be used for feature reduction?
- is this even needed or can we use all features?


How to use histogram data:
- use each bin as feature?
- calculate mean, variance for each distribution and use this as feature instead


How to include costs for missclassification in our algorithm?
 - maybe this: "http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/svm/plot_weighted_samples.html"?


Using Cross Validation?
